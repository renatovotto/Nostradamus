    "In this project, we will aim to use a Machine Learning model to predict the daily prices of the Tesla stock. Along with several technical indicators derived from the OHLCV data, we will feed into the model also the sentiment scores of relevant Twitter posts, thus leveraging **Sentiment Analysis**, a Natural Language Processing technique. All these data will be used to train the model, which in turn will predict the trading signals. Finally, we will backtest the trading strategy and display some performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis and generally the positive or negative sentiment on news about a stock has been studied in depth in the recent years, finding a strong correlation between the sentiment scores of such data and the stock price movement <sup><a href='#References'>[1]</a></sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labels we need to predict are the buy and sell signals, which we will assign based on simple price conditions in order to train the model. Since these are discrete data, the problem we are trying to solve is a supervised classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Machine Learning model we will use is the **Random Forest Classifier**. Random Forests are supervised algorithms consisting of multiple decision trees performing well with non-linear data and with low risk of overfitting. They are also strong against outliers, although they suffer from low interpretability compared to single decision trees <sup><a href='#References'>[2]</a></sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reliability of the Random Forest in predicting stock prices is widely confirmed by many studies, suggesting the robustness of this model when compared to other machine learning algorithms. The paper \"Predicting Stock Market Price Direction with Uncertainty Using Quantile Regression Forest\" <sup><a href='#References'>[3]</a></sup> raises an observation regarding the uncertainty of the predictions of the Random Forest model, stating that it's a scarcely studied subject. This is surely an aspect worth to investigate for researchers, given the financial risk involved with applications such as algorithmic trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will also leverage various techniques, data structures and paradigms, such as **concurrency** and **parallel processing**, **functional and object-oriented programming**, **idempotence**, **Direct Acyclic Graph** and **data pipeline**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intention behind this project is to implement the end-to-end workflow of the backtesting of an **Algorithmic Trading** strategy in a program with a sleek interface, and with a level of automation such that the user is able to tailor the details of the strategy and the output of the program by entering a minimal amount of data, partly even in an **interactive** way. This should make the program **reusable**, meaning that it's easy to carry out the backtesting of the trading strategy on a different asset. Furthermore, the **modularity** of the software design should facilitate changes to adapt the program to different requirements (i.e. different data or ML models).\n",

    "The intention behind the pipeline, as mentioned earlier, is to abstract the download and manipulation of data from the user. This means that we want to handle any variations the user wants to bring in sourcing the data (mostly tweets, but also dates of the period of the analysis and historical prices consequently).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we have to keep a log of the status for the content of data, prices and tweets, in the root folder. Thus, if the user changes any of the download parameters, the pipeline will handle that change and download only what has been added and delete what has been suppressed from the parameters. This will give complete control on the files downloaded and manipulated by just altering the download parameters dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will achieve this by naming the files based on all the parameters, so that there is an unambiguous relation between download parameters and file names, which allows us to scan the data folder and let the pipeline execute the job needed to update all the data based on the current download parameters.\n",

The only drawback with this setting is that a significant number of tweets chunks dataset will be produced. On the other hand, this is not a problem, as the function \"concat_most_popular_tweets_chunks\" downstream will take care of aggregating in one unique dataset all the most popular tweets. Furthermore, the program is designed so that if the download fails halfway, a new run of the pipeline with the same download parameters will take care of downloading solely what failed at the previous attempt. Then any failures on the most popular tweets download won't affect the next attempt and the task will be taken from the point it failed. If in doubt about an incomplete tweets' dataset, just delete it manually from the folder, and it will be downloaded at the next run.\n",

    "Each of the following methods are somehow interconnected and called in chain if we run a method downstream in the backtesting process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope behind this design is to be able to focus on a particular step when calling the relevant method, such as preprocessing the data or training the model, and when calling a more downstream method the upstream methods will be called and prompted to the user if useful or needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, if we call the \"strategy_performance\" method, but the model is not trained and/or the hyperparameters are not saved, the program will prompt to train the model first in order to proceed with the backtesting. Or if there are still missing values in the final dataset, the \"preprocess_data\" method will throw a warning and exit the program, regardless of where the method was called from. Thus, the methods are interlaced in a sort of pipeline where recursion is leveraged if needed."
